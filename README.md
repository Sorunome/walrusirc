# WalrusIRC

WalrusIRC is an alternate OmnomIRC client built using node.js and socket.io.

## Installation

First configure and install a traditional installation of [OmnomIRC](https://github.com/Sorunome/OmnomIRC2), copy this repository anywhere, copy '''config.json.example''' to '''config.json''' and modify it to your needs, install the needed dependencies with '''npm install''' and run it using '''npm start'''.

## Todo

This client is not done yet, not every functionality is there yet and everything can change wildly between commits...
